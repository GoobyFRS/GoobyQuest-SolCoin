# GoobyQuest-SolCoin
<b>What is GoobyQuest?</b> GoobyQuest is a Solana token I created while watching NetworkChuck videos. <br>
I used this oppritunity to learn more about NFTs and the Solana crypto-currency. Inittialy I considered this would be fun to integrate into a Minecraft server economy. <br>
Since showing this to my brothers and Mom, we have instead been using this as kind of a barganing token and its been fun to actually use!<br>
<b>Symbol:</b> GBYQ <br>
<b>Total Minted:</b> 10,000 tokens.
